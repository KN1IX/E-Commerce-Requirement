Project Report: Zak’s Game Discs Website
Overview & Design Decisions

The “Zak’s Game Discs” website was developed to serve as a straightforward and visually engaging e-commerce platform, allowing users to browse a curated selection of Xbox One physical game discs. The design prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness by leveraging Bootstrap 5.3 for layout and styling. This framework helped ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience.

A clean and modern interface was chosen to highlight product visuals, which are essential for gaming audiences who often recognize titles by their box art. The homepage features a welcoming message, a brief introduction, and a featured game catalog displayed in a tabular format. Each game entry includes a product image, title, price, and a link to a dedicated product page for more details—supporting easy navigation and comparison.

Font Awesome icons and Bootstrap’s button and table styles were incorporated to enhance interactivity and visual appeal without excessive custom CSS. Additionally, navigation is handled via a fixed top navbar, keeping important links (Home, About, Contact) readily accessible.

Target Audience

The primary audience for this website consists of Xbox One gamers—specifically those who prefer collecting or purchasing physical discs rather than digital downloads. This includes casual players looking for deals on popular titles, retro game enthusiasts seeking older releases, and budget-conscious shoppers searching for quality games at discounted prices. The interface was designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that even users with limited technical experience can browse and shop with ease.

Development Challenges

One of the main challenges during development was balancing visual content and performance. High-resolution images of game covers are essential to the user experience but can impact page load times. To address this, image sizes were optimized for web without compromising quality.

Another challenge involved organizing product information in a way that was both mobile-friendly and comprehensive. The use of a responsive Bootstrap table provided a solution that maintained structure while adapting to different screen sizes.

Ensuring consistent design across multiple linked product pages was also a consideration, particularly when using shared styles and navigation elements. This was partially resolved through modular HTML and shared CSS files.

Conclusion

Overall, Zak’s Game Discs offers a streamlined, user-friendly platform for browsing Xbox One game discs. With an emphasis on visual clarity, ease of navigation, and responsive design, the site effectively caters to its target audience. While future iterations could benefit from features like search filters, shopping carts, and user reviews, this version lays a solid foundation for expanding the project into a fully functional e-commerce platform.
