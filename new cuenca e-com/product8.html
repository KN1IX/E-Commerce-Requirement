        <h2>Splinter Cell Blacklist</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Two years after Third Echelon is dissolved, Sam Fisher takes up work as a contractor for Paladin 9 Security – a mercenary contractor run by his friend Victor Coste. While assigned to a USAF base in Guam, a military force assaults the installation, neutralizing its commander and hundreds of its members, while heavily injuring Coste. A faction known as the "Engineers" publicly declare their responsibility for the operation, announcing it will launch a retaliation on the United States until it recalls its troops deployed abroad. U.S. President Caldwell appoint Sam and his colleagues – tech specialist Charlie Cole, CIA operative Isaac Briggs, and technical analyst Anna Grímsdóttir – in to Fourth Echelon, a new top secret black-ops unit which conducts out of a converted military cargo plane known as "the Paladin".</p>
