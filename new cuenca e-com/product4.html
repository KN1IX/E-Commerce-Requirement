        <h2>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Ace Combat 7 is set in the series' fictional universe of Strangereal, where Earth has entirely different nations, geography, and history.[1] The game's story details the 2019 Lighthouse War, fought between the Osean Federation and the Kingdom of Erusea in the continent of Usea. Following the Continental War, Osea brokered a peace treaty between the Federal Republic of Erusea and the rest of the Usean continent, while the International Union (IUN) formed the IUN Peacekeeping Force (IUN-PKF) to maintain peace there. Players control the game's silent protagonist, Osean fighter pilot "Trigger". The game's frame story is told through pre-rendered cutscenes played between missions, primarily from the point of view of three characters: Avril Mead, an Osean civilian aircraft mechanic who broke wartime aviation laws and is forced to work in an Osean penal military unit; Rosa Cossette D'Elise, the princess and heir of the Erusean throne who believes the war will end Osean interference on the continent; and Dr. Schroeder, a Belkan scientist developing advanced combat drone technology for the Erusean military.</p>
